    <p>
      Use this service to secure government funding for a non-levy employer to train an apprentice.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Your non-levy employer must give you permission to secure funding for them. To do this, the employer will need to log on to their apprenticeship account and give you permission to secure funds on their dashboard.
    </p>

    <!-- {{govukInsetText({
      text: "You can only secure funding up to 6 months before the apprenticeship training is about to start."
    })}} -->

    <p>
      Before you start you will need: 
    </p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>
        an estimate of which month the apprentice will start the apprenticeship training, which can be flexible up to 3 months
      </li>
      <li>
        an idea of the <a href="https://findapprenticeshiptraining.sfa.bis.gov.uk/">apprenticeship training</a> the apprentice will take, which can be changed later
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You will be securing funding for 1 apprentice. Repeat the process for more apprentices.
