    <p>
      Use this service to reserve government funding for a non-levy employer to train an apprentice. You can reserve funding no more than 6 months in advance of the apprenticeship training start date.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Your employer must give you permission to reserve funding for them. To do this, the employer will need to sign in to their apprenticeship account and go to &lsquo;training provider permissions&rsquo; on their dashboard.
    </p>

    <!-- {{govukInsetText({
      text: "You can only secure funding up to 6 months before the apprenticeship training is about to start."

    <p>
      Before you start you will need: 
    </p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>
        an estimate of which month the apprentice will start the apprenticeship training, which can be flexible up to 3 months
      </li>
      <li>
        the <a href="https://findapprenticeshiptraining.sfa.bis.gov.uk/">apprenticeship training course</a> the apprentice will take, which can be changed later
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You will be reserving funding for one apprentice at a time.
