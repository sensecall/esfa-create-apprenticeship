        Reserve funding for training an apprentice
      </h1>

      <p>
       Apprenticeship funding can pay for part or all of the cost of training an apprentice - up to the funding band maximum. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apprenticeship-funding-rules" target="_blank">You may need to pay</a> up to a maximum of 5% of the total cost of the training and assessment. 
     </p>

     <p>
      To ensure apprenticeship funding is available for your apprenticeship training, you will need reserve funding. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The reservation can be no more than 6 months in advance of the apprenticeâ€™s planned apprenticeship training start date.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
      What you'll need
    </h2>

    <p>
      To reserve apprenticeship funding you will need: 
    </p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>
        an estimate of which month the apprentice will start their apprenticeship training, which can be flexible up to 3 months
      </li>
      <li>
        the <a href="#">apprenticeship training</a> the apprentice will take, which can be changed later 
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You will be reserving funding for 1 apprentice at a time. Repeat the process for more apprentices.
