				Government funding can pay for part or all of the cost of training an apprentice - up to the funding band maximum. You may need to pay up to a maximum of 5% of the total cost of the training.
			</p>

			<p>
				To ensure government funds are available for your apprenticeship training, you will need reserve funding.
			</p>

			<p>
				The reservation can be no more than 6 months in advance of the apprenticeâ€™s planned apprenticeship training start date.  
			</p>

			<!-- <p>
				Go to <a href="#">apprenticeship funding</a> to find out how much you are allowed.

				What you'll need
			</h2>

			<p>
				To reserve government funding you will need: 
			</p>

			<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
				<li>
					an estimate of which month the apprentice will start their apprenticeship training, which can be flexible up to 3 months 
				</li>
				<li>

				</li>
