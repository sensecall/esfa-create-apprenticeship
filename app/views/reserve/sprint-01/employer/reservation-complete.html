      What you need to do now
    </h1>

    <p>
      Once you have finalised the details of the apprenticeship with your chosen training provider, you will need to add this information to your reservation.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can add these now if you already know them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Both you and the training provider will need to check and approve this information before the apprenticeship starts so that the correct funding can be paid to your training provider.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
      If you haven't chosen a Training provider
    </h2>

    <p>
      If you donâ€™t know which training provider you want to use then you can use the <a href="#">Find Apprenticeship Training</a> service to search for a provider who offers the apprenticeship you would like to offer.
    </p>
