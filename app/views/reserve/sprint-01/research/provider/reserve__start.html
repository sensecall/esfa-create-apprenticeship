      Secure funding for taking on an apprentice
    </h1>{{releaseVersion | log }}

    <p>
      Use this service to secure government funding for a non-levy employer to train an apprentice. <a href="#">Government funding</a> will pay for part or all of the cost of training an apprentice.
    </p>

    <!-- {{ govukWarningText({
      html: "From April 2019, you will not be able to secure any funding for training an aprentice. Any funding you have secured before April 2019 will not be affected.",
      iconFallbackText: "Current Funding restrictions"
    }) }} -->

    <p>
      Before you start you will need:
